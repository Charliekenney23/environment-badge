# Environment Badge

This is a simple __environment badge__, which can be used to indicate what application environment you're currently in. For now, environments are hard-coded to what we use at DoSomething.org.

## Usage
If you're building your application with [Webpack](), [Create React App](), or a similar tool, simply import this module:

```
import 'environment-badge';
```

For applications without a front-end build system, you can embed this script from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/environment-badge@0.0.1/dist.js"></script>
```
